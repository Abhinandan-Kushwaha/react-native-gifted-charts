# 🎉 1.4.10

## ✨ Features added-

Added the prop `onMomentumScrollEnd` to Bar and Line charts. It can be used to fire an event when scroll is completed. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/601

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.9

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added support for multiple lines corresponding to secondary y-axis. Now we can add the property `isSecondary` inside the objects of the `dataSet` array. When using isSecondary, make sure to pass the `secondaryYAxis` prop. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/586

3. Added support for `pieInnerComponent` to `<PieChartPro>`

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.8 Mega Release ⭐️

## ✨ Features added-
### Animation in Pie and donut charts using the __`<PieChartPro>`__ component. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/555
### Curved paths (border-radius) in donut sections supported using the __`<PieChartPro>`__ component. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/554
### Support for expo gradient, thanks to onyx-flame for his PR https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/pull/571


## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. refactors and adjustments related to xAxisThickness and yAxisOffset. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/574

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.7

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Fixed the issue - `animateOnDataChange` skipping the initial render, thus rendering an empty chart. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/537
2. Fixed the issue - `yAxisOffset` not working with `dataSet` in Line (and Area) charts.

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.6

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added the properties `shiftTextBackgroundX` and `shiftTextBackgroundY` to data items of Pie (and donut) charts. If we pass `shiftTextX`, the background will also shift (because the library assigns a default value of shiftTextBackgroundX = shiftTextX). This can be _overridden_ by manually passing **shiftTextBackgroundX**. Same applies to `shiftTextBackgroundY`

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Fixed the issue- _"shiftTextX not working to focused section of the Pie (and donut) charts"_ Thanks to **YASH-TRONX** for his PR https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/pull/534
2. Fixed the issue- **line inside Bar (combined chart) getting cropped from right side in case of _secondary_** See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/532
   This actually got fixed in the core library (version 0.0.16). Here I just had to use the latest version of _gifted-charts-core_

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.5

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added the prop `onScroll` to Bar, Stacked Bar, Line and Area charts. It is a callback function that takes _event_ as a parameter.
2. Added the props `paddingHorizontal` and `paddingVertical` to Pie (and Donut) charts. This will be useful to accomodate _"onBorder"_ labels. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/discussions/528

## 🐛 Bug fixes

Fixed issue with `barInnerComponent` for Bar charts that don't have gradient. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/500#issuecomment-1920895288

---

---

---

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.3

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added `interpolation` to Line charts. These props can be used to control interpolation- `interpolateMissingValues`, `showDataPointsForMissingValues` and `onlyPositive`. See **[Interpolation in Line chart docs](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/blob/master/docs/LineChart/LineChartProps.md#interpolation)**
2. Added `BEFORE_DATA_POINT` to `EdgePosition` enum for step charts, and renamed the `AT_DATA_POINT` EdgePosition to `AFTER_DATA_POINT`. The default EdgePosition is `AFTER_DATA_POINT`.

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Fixed the issue- _"topLabelComponent not visible for bar charts"_. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/519
2. Fixed RTL issue in pagination. Thanks to Houssem-Eddine Kellou for his PR https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/gifted-charts-core/pull/3

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.4.2

## ✨ Features added-

Added the props `focusBarOnPress` and `focusedBarConfig` to Bar charts. Using these, we can focus or highlight a bar on press. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/512

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Fixed issues with `stepValue`, `noOfSections` and `maxValue`. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/511
2. Fixed issue with pagination, (isCloseToStart not returning true) PR https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/gifted-charts-core/pull/2 by **Houssem-Eddine Kellou**

---

# 🎉 1.4.0 Mega Release ⭐️

## 📣 This release contains a huge refactor. 🔨 We have now moved most of the logic and maths (including utils, constatnts and types) to our newly launched library named [gifted-charts-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gifted-charts-core)

This helped in-

1. Segragating UI and logic
2. Modularity and code re-usability
3. We are very soon going to launch a library for **web** named `react-gifted-charts`❤️ With this we will be able to render charts in **react** using exactly the same code we use in react-native-gifted-charts!
<p>
This huge refactor might have introduced some bugs. Please bear with us.🙏<br/>
To avoid this in future mega releases, I am going to add thorough tests in the next release.
<br /><br/>
We will soon release version 2.0 after adding all types and unit tests for each component!!
</p>

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.31

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Fixed issue with onPress not working on elements just above the chart. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/497 <br/>
   It was an issue with the <ScrollView> of the chart overflowing and overlapping in case stepHeight was large.

2. Fixed the issue- `showStripOnFocus`: height of strip becomes smaller when using `overflowTop`.

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.27

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added support for mix of positive + negative values in Stacked Bar charts. Thanks to Christoph who added this feature through his PR- https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/pull/470
2. Added the prop `yAxisExtraHeight` for extra length of Y axis at the top. Default value is 1/20th of the chart height.
3. Added the prop `inwardExtraLengthForFocused`. This allows us to render donut charts whose focused section grows inwards. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/325

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Earlier, charts used to have an extra length of Y axis equal to `sectionHeight/2` at the top. Due to this, charts' height used to change along with `sectionHeight`. Fixed this by making the default value of `yAxisExtraHeight` to a constant value which equals 1/20th of the chart height. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/467
2. Fixed the issue with `getPointerProps` which threw a warning - `Cannot update a component (xxx) while rendering a different component (yyy)`. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/22633

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.24

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added `pointerConfig` support to Stacked Bar charts.

2. Added `barBorderWidth` and `barBorderColor` to Bar charts.

3. Added separate `spacing` for Line charts inside BarCharts. The line rendered in a Bar chart can have its own `spacing` value independent from the spacing of the bars. It can be set using the `spacing` property in the `lineConfig` object.

4. Added these props to apply border radius to Stacked Bar charts-
<ul>
   <li> stackBorderRadius </li>
   <li> stackBorderTopLeftRadius </li>

2. Added the prop `highlightedRange` to render the parts of lines lying in a given data range with a different style (color, thickness,type). See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70406903/different-colors-line-chart-with-react-native-chart-kit

```ts
type HighlightedRange = {
  from: number;
  to: number;
  color?: string | ColorValue;
  thickness?: number;
  strokeDashArray?: Array<number>;
};
```

3. Added the property `pointerEvents` to the `pointerConfig` object. If you have a Pressable / Touchable item in your `pointerLabelComponent`, then you should set `pointerEvents` to **'auto'** inside the pointerConfig object. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/447

## 🐛 Bug fixes

1. Fixed the issue - Unwanted Spacing below the charts.See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/448

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.19

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added support for dynamic number of lines with the help of the `dataSet` prop. We can now pass an array of data instead of using `data`, `data2`, `data3` etc.
2. Added property `formatYLabel` to the `secondaryYAxis`, so we can now format the labels of the secondary Y-Axis using `formatYLabel`. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/442

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.17

## ✨ Features added-

1. Added support for Step charts. To render a step chart, just pass the prop `stepChart` to the `<LineChart>` component. <br />
   See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/438 <br/>

2. Added the properties- `initialPointerIndex`, `initialPointerAppearDelay`, and `persistPointer` to the `pointerConfig` object. See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/427

3. Added support for customizing individual / specific rules in charts using the prop `rulesConfigArray`.
   See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/432#issuecomment-1817965308

4. Added 2 new props- `xAxisLabelsHeight` and `xAxisLabelsVerticalShift`. Here's a brief description of the use case of these props-
<p>
The height of X axis labels container is computed automatically. Sometimes you may need to explicitly provide the height of X-axis labels container. An example case is when the font size of label texts is large. Use the `xAxisLabelsHeight`` prop if the labels appear cropped from bottom.

_Note- Using the `xAxisLabelsHeight` prop may shift the X axis labels up or down, making the label text overlap with the chart content. In such a case you can use the `xAxisLabelsVerticalShift`` prop to adjust the vertical position of X axis labels._

See https://github.com/Abhinandan-Kushwaha/react-native-gifted-charts/issues/433

2. Fixed Y axis label issue which displayed NaN as a label when we used `yAxisOffset` and `yAxisLabelTexts` props together.

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.5

🐛 Minor bug fixes

---

---

---

# 🎉 1.3.4 Major release

## ✨ Features added-

### 1. Y axis on both sides

Added the `secondaryYAxis` prop to render a secondary Y axis on the right side of the chart. Earliear we were able to render the Y axis either on the left or on the right side, not both.

### 2. secondaryData and secondaryLineConfig (in Line and Area charts)

In addition to data2, data3, etc, now we have the `secondaryData` prop. This is done to reference the second line to the secondary Y axis.

### 3. scrollRef

In Bar, Line and Area charts, we can access the ScrollView using the `scrollRef` prop. You just need to create a ref using React.useRef() and pass it into the scrollRef prop. The most common use of scrollRef is to scroll to a given position, and to fire the scroll on an event like a button press.

### 4. scrollToIndex

In Bar, Line and Area charts, we can scroll to any given index using the `scrollToIndex` prop.

### 5. RTL horizontal charts

To render a horizontal Bar chart from right to left, pass the `rtl` prop along with the `horizontal` prop.

### 6. curveType and curvature

Now, we support 2 types of curves-

1. Cubic bezier curve
2. Quadratic bezier curve

The default curveType is cubiz bezier curve. To change it to quadratic, pass the prop `curveType={CurveType.QUADRATIC}`<br />
<br/>
`curvature` takes a value between 0 and 1. The default curvature value is `0.2`<br/>
curvature works only for cubic bezier curves. When curvature value is 0, the curve becomes straight line.

### 7. showValuesAsDataPointsText

In Line and area charts, we can pass the `showValuesAsDataPointsText` prop to display the value of the data points.

### 8. Animation in stacked Bar chart

The `isAnimated` prop is now supported in stacked bar charts.

### 9. endSpacing

Similar to the `initialSpacing` we now have a prop named `endSpacing` as well.

### 10. overflowBottom

Similar to the `overflowTop` we now have a prop named `overflowBottom` as well, but it makes sense only for line and area charts. It gives extra space at the bottom of the chart to make room for dataPoints or dataPointText.

## 🐛 Fixes

### 1. Support for expo ❤️

The library used to break when used in an expo project. This was perhaps due to version conflicts in react-native-svg. We have now moved both `react-native-svg` and `react-native-linear-gradient` to peer dependencies. This should hopefully fix the issues with expo.

### 2. Fixed the issue with pointerConfig being jaggy on Android

`autoAdjustPointerLabelPosition` is now false by default. This should make the Area and Line charts with pointerConfig smooth on Android.
