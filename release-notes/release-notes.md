# Features added-

### 1. Y axis on both sides

Added the `secondaryYAxis` prop to render a secondary Y axis on the right side of the chart. Earliear we were able to render the Y axis either on the left or on the right side, not both.

### 2. secondaryData and secondaryLineConfig (in Line and Area charts)

In addition to data2, data3, etc, now we have the `secondaryData` prop. This is done to reference the second line to the secondary Y axis.

### 3. scrollRef

In Bar, Line and Area charts, we can access the ScrollView using the `scrollRef` prop. You just need to create a ref using React.useRef() and pass it into the scrollRef prop. The most common use of scrollRef is to scroll to a given position, and to fire the scroll on an event like a button press.

### 4. scrollToIndex
In Bar, Line and Area charts, we can scroll to any given index using the `scrollToIndex` prop.

### 5. RTL horizontal charts
To render a horizontal Bar chart from right to left, pass the `rtl` prop along with the `horizontal` prop.

### 6. curveType and curvature
Now, we support 2 types of curves-

1. Cubic bezier curve
2. Quadratic bezier curve

The default curveType is cubiz bezier curve. To change it to quadratic, pass the prop `curveType={CurveType.QUADRATIC}`<br />
<br/>
`curvature` takes a value between 0 and 1. The default curvature value is `0.2`<br/>
curvature works only for cubic bezier curves. When curvature value is 0, the curve becomes straight line.


### 7. showValuesAsDataPointsText

In Line and area charts, we can pass the `showValuesAsDataPointsText` prop to display the value of the data points.

### 8. Animation in stacked Bar chart
The `isAnimated` prop is now supported in stacked bar charts.

### 9. endSpacing
Similar to the `initialSpacing` we now have a prop named `endSpacing` as well.

# Fixes

### 1. Support for expo ðŸŽ‰
The library used to break when used in an expo project. This was perhaps due to version conflicts in react-native-svg. We have now moved both `react-native-svg` and `react-native-linear-gradient` to peer dependencies. This should hopefully fix the issues with expo.

### 2. Fixed the issue with pointerConfig being jaggy on Android
`autoAdjustPointerLabelPosition` is now false by default. This should make the Area and Line charts with pointerConfig smooth on Android.
