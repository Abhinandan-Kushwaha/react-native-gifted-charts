The most complete library for Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Donut and Stacked Bar charts in React Native. Allows 2D, 3D, gradient, animations and live data updates.

### Yet another chart library? Why?

**_To bring Life to your data_**

1. Plenty of features with minimal code
2. Apply animations to your charts on load and on value change, just by adding a prop
3. Smooth animations implemented using LayoutAnimation
4. Clickable and scrollable
5. Three-D and gradient effects
6. Fully customizable (see the [props](docs/docs.md))
7. Detailed [documentation](https://gifted-charts.web.app/) with examples
8. Support for **_combined_** Bar and Line charts

**Alert:**

This library doesn't support web apps yet. Use this library if you are planning mobile first.</br>
However, we are planning to add support for web which will be available soon.

## Usage

The simplest usage of various types of charts can be done as below-

```js
import { BarChart, LineChart, PieChart } from "react-native-gifted-charts";

// ...
const data=[ {value:50}, {value:80}, {value:90}, {value:70} ]

<BarChart data = {data} />
<LineChart data = {data} />
<PieChart data = {data} />

// For Horizontal Bar chart, just add the prop horizontal to the <BarChart/> component

<BarChart data = {data} horizontal />

// For Area chart, just add the prop areaChart to the <LineChart/> component

<LineChart data = {data} areaChart />

// For Donut chart, just add the prop donut to the <PieChart/> component

<PieChart data = {data} donut />
```
