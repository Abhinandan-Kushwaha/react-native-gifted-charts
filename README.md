3. Smooth animations implemented using LayoutAnimation
4. Clickable and scrollable
5. Three-D and gradient effects
6. Fully customizable (see the [props](docs/docs.md))
7. Detailed [documentation](https://gifted-charts.web.app/) with examples

## Usage

The simplest usage of various types of charts can be done as below-

```js
import { BarChart, LineChart, PieChart, PopulationPyramid } from "react-native-gifted-charts";

// ...
const data=[ {value:50}, {value:80}, {value:90}, {value:70} ]

<BarChart data = {data} />
<LineChart data = {data} />
<PieChart data = {data} />
<PopulationPyramid data = {[{left:10,right:12}, {left:9,right:8}]} />

// For Horizontal Bar chart, just add the prop horizontal to the <BarChart/> component

<BarChart data = {data} horizontal />

// For Area chart, just add the prop areaChart to the <LineChart/> component

<LineChart data = {data} areaChart />

// For Donut chart, just add the prop donut to the <PieChart/> component

<PieChart data = {data} donut />
```
