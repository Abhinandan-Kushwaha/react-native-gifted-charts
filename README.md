The most complete library for Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Donut, Stacked Bar and Population Pyramid charts in React Native. Allows 2D, 3D, gradient, animations and live data updates.

### Yet another chart library? Why?

**_To bring Life to your data_**

1. Plenty of features with minimal code
2. Apply animations to your charts on load and on value change, just by adding a prop
3. Smooth animations implemented using LayoutAnimation
4. Clickable and scrollable
5. Three-D and gradient effects
6. Fully customizable (see the [props](docs/docs.md))
7. Detailed [documentation](https://gifted-charts.web.app/) with examples
8. Support for **_combined_** Bar and Line charts
9. Tested to be pixel perfect using [react-native-screenshot-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-screenshot-test). See [the screenshot tests here](https://abhinandan-kushwaha.github.io/TestingCharts/ss-test/test.html)

The web counterpart of this library is public now. Try out our new reactJS library- [react-gifted-charts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-gifted-charts) <br />
The exact same piece of code that you write to render charts in react-native, can be used to render charts in reactJS using this library!

## Installation

### React Native CLI

```sh
npm install react-native-gifted-charts react-native-linear-gradient react-native-svg
```

### Expo

```sh
npx expo install react-native-gifted-charts expo-linear-gradient react-native-svg
```

Please note that `react-native-svg` and `react-native-linear-gradient`/`expo-linear-gradient` are needed for the library to work, so make sure they are installed in your project. <br />
**[gifted-charts-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gifted-charts-core)** contains the mathematical and logical utilities used by this library.

## Usage

The simplest usage of various types of charts can be done as below-

```js
import { BarChart, LineChart, PieChart, PopulationPyramid } from "react-native-gifted-charts";

// ...
const data=[ {value:50}, {value:80}, {value:90}, {value:70} ]

<BarChart data = {data} />
<LineChart data = {data} />
<PieChart data = {data} />
<PopulationPyramid data = {[{left:10,right:12}, {left:9,right:8}]} />

// For Horizontal Bar chart, just add the prop horizontal to the <BarChart/> component

<BarChart data = {data} horizontal />

// For Area chart, just add the prop areaChart to the <LineChart/> component

<LineChart data = {data} areaChart />

// For Donut chart, just add the prop donut to the <PieChart/> component

<PieChart data = {data} donut />
```
