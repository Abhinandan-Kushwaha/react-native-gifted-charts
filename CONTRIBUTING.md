# Contributions are welcome ü§ù

Pull requests are most welcome!

### Instructions

1. Go through the [dev docs](docs/dev/index.md) to understand the architecture of the library.
2. Clone the repo and then create a new branch. </br>

The name of the new branch should follow this naming convention - </br>
1. For a new feature- **feat/feature-name**
2. For a bug fix, **fix/whatever-fix**

Don't forget to add a title and a description that explain the issue you're trying to solve and your suggested solution.
Screenshots and gifs are VERY helpful. Please do NOT format the files as we are trying to keep a unified syntax and the reviewing process fast and simple.
